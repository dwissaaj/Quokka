This repository is a collection of a lot of NLP libraries like Spacy,Tensorflo,gensim,Networkx and many more. The main reason I create this
repo is much easier to analyze text data with a single module rather than create separate project for each NLP library.
This modul contain simple writing to code since it only have basic function and class in NLP library. For a same dataset you can use gensim for topic modelling
and do sentiment analysis with a single project.
